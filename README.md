# Lotus Super Seven Replica (a.k.a RG Seven)

Hey! this is my attempt to build a replica of the lightest street legal roadster ever made, the Lotus Super Seven. I'm using the drawings of Chris Gibbs book, Builld Your Own Sports Car On a Budget. I will redraw all the technical drawings using QCad in order to use them on the shop instead of the book. If you find this drawing useful for you leet me know it.
