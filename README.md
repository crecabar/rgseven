# Lotus Super Seven Replica

Hey! This is my attempt to build a replica of the lightest street-legal roadster ever made, the Lotus Super Seven. I'm using the drawings from Chris Gibbs's book, Build Your Own Sports Car On a Budget. I will redraw all the technical drawings using QCad to use them in the shop instead of the book. If you find this drawing useful for you let me know it.
